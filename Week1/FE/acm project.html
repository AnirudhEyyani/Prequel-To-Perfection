                    Jarad Anthony Higgins (December 2, 1998 â€“ December 8, 2019), known professionally as Juice Wrld
                    (pronounced "juice world"; stylized as Juice WRLD), was an American rapper, singer, and songwriter
                    from
                    Chicago. His song "Lucid Dreams" has been played on the music streaming platform Spotify over one
                    billion times and peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100. "Lucid Dreams", along with his
                    earlier
                    hit single "All Girls Are the Same", helped him secure a recording contract with Lil Bibby's Grade A
                    Productions and Interscope Records. He derived his stage name from late American rapper Tupac Shakur
                    and
                    his part in the film Juice and that it represents taking over the world.

                Jarad Anthony Higgins was born on December 2, 1998, in Chicago, Illinois. He grew up in the South
                Suburbs
                spending his childhood in Calumet Park and later moved to Homewood, where he attended Homewood-Flossmoor
                High School and graduated in 2017. His parents divorced when he was three years old, and his father
                left, leaving his mother to raise him as a single mother along with one older brother. Higgins' mother
                was very religious and conservative, and did not let him listen to hip hop. He was allowed to listen to
                rock
                and pop music, however, and he found this on video games such as Tony Hawk's Pro Skater and Guitar Hero,
                which introduced him to artists like Billy Idol, Blink-182, Black Sabbath, Fall Out Boy, Megadeth and
                Panic!
                at the Disco.

                Higgins was a heavy drug user during his childhood and teens. He began drinking lean in sixth grade and
                using percocets and xanax in 2013. Higgins also smoked cigarettes briefly before quitting in his last
                year
                of high school because of health issues.

                He learned to play the piano at four years old, having been inspired by his mother, Carmella Wallace,
                who
                later began paying for lessons. He then took up the guitar and drums. Higgins also played trumpet for
                band
                class. In his sophomore year of high school, he began posting songs to his SoundCloud which he recorded
                on his smartphone. Around this time, Higgins began to take rapping more seriously.
